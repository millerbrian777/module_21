Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

this analysis was for us to determine the success of the application type of these organizations. using a nueral network.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
    the variables we are using for the features are 'application type' and 'application classification'   the target is the 'Is successsful'
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
  the variables we are using for the features are:
'application type', 'application classification' , 
'USE_CASE',	'ORGANIZATION	STATUS',	'INCOME_AMT',	'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS','ASK_AMT'	
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

'EIN'	'NAME' are the variables that we removed. 

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

I used 3 layers for my nueral network. I was unable to acheive the goal of 75% but i was able to get very close. 
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

I intially started with only 2 hidden layers and one outer layer. then i changed it to 3. it was closer but still not the goal.
